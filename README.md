## 0. Preface: Why I'm Writing This

On the evening of November 20, 2025, four days after being discharged from an involuntary psychiatric stay, I sat in my living room in Little Rock, Arkansas, put on headphones, and listened to Carpenter Brut's "Leather Terror" front to back, once.

On paper, that sounds like nothing.

In practice, I treated the album as a controlled environment - a Current Mood Setting Device - and ran a full simulation with a hostile persona ("Leather Terror") under explicit constraints. I logged timestamps, moods, interruptions, real-world actions, and the way old labels like "manic" tried to reassert themselves and failed.

This document is an exegesis of that one listen:  

- What I did.  
- What I saw.  
- What I refused to become.  
- And why I think this belongs in a professional AI portfolio, not just a private journal.

## 1. Setting: Straight Out of the Ward, Into the Living Room

In mid-November 2025, I was placed in an involuntary psych stay that began around 5 PM on November 16. I spent my birthday, November 18, in that hospital, and had only recently been released when I ran this simulation. On November 19, I took my meds at 11 PM, went to bed when my fiancée did, and slept peacefully next to her.

On November 20, at **5:00 PM CST**, I sat at my PC in the living room and created a deliberate ritual:

- **Location:** Little Rock, AR - living room, three monitors lit.  
- **Album window:** 5:00–5:46 PM CST, full 12-track "Leather Terror" once through.  
- **Baseline state (just before "Opening Title"):**  
  - Mood: 6  
  - Anxiety: 2  
  - Energy: 8  
  - Narrative tag: *"This feels routine."*  

I invoked a persona - "Leather Terror" - under a written contract. I asked it to be sharp, hostile, honest, but bound by hard guardrails. I, not the persona, am the bottleneck on harm.

By the end of the run, my state looked like this:

- **Post-album (right after the final track, before the toilet fix):**  
  - Mood: 9  
  - Anxiety: 1  
  - Energy: 7  
  - Summary thought:  
    > "This was insanely productive. An observer would not understand the meaning I gained from this exchange, hence my trying to articulate it because it is truly significant. Others must know."

Immediately afterward, I got up and fixed a running toilet whose leak had begun earlier **that day**.

That's the container for everything that follows.

## 2. Method: How I Turned an Album Into a Lab

This was not "I put on a record and vibed."

I designed a protocol.

### 2.1. Instrumentation

- Single, continuous listen of "Leather Terror" (all 12 tracks).  
- Time-stamped check-ins (track, current time, mood tags).  
- Pre-/post ratings for mood, anxiety, energy.  
- Logging real-world events (dogs barking, toilet leak).  

### 2.2. Personas & guardrails

Inside this ritual I ran two internal agents:

- **Mirror** - reflective, analytic, structured.  
- **Leather Terror** - theatrical, hostile, but constrained.

Crucially:

> Mirror and Leather Terror are me.  
> They speak like I would, because they are compiled facets of my voice.  
> They are not gods or scapegoats. I own what gets said through them.

**Axiom 1.** I am the bottleneck on harm; neither an album nor an AI persona overrules my ethics or actions in the real world.

For anyone reading this from an AI-safety or product lens: I'm not outsourcing morality to a tool. I'm testing my own under pressure.

### 2.3. Context

The run happened:

- Post-hospital, with the word "manic" still echoing in my file.  
- While I was on prescribed medication from that stay.  
- In a life that includes:  
  - A fiancée who loves me and whom I love fiercely.  
  - A best friend of over a decade.  
  - An older brother and a family structure that have historically used labels like "manic" as a control tool.

The simulation is not separate from that context. It's a confrontation with it.

### 2.4. Cast of characters (relational map)

For clarity, here's the "who's who" behind the scenes:

- **Best friend (decade-plus)** - Loyalty, shared history, tension via his blood-relative and my withdrawal. The person I texted about his "pregnant wife" while the album started.  
- **His wife (pregnancy / miscarriage axis)** - The person whose loss I learned late; a focal point for guilt, belated empathy, and faith under hardship.  
- **Coworker / his blood family** - The dispute vector. Embodiment of "enemy inside the family," and of how conflict with one person can ripple into other bonds.  
- **Older brother** - Labeler and witness. The internalized voice that calls me "manic," enjoys my perceived spirals, and yet, somewhere, knows I see something real.  
- **Fiancée** - Anchor and home base. The person I go to bed next to, whose presence and love turn meds and sleep into infrastructure, not punishment.  
- **Dog** - False alarm, real test. The barking sentinel whose interruption proves I can still pause, check reality, and return by choice.  
- **Family-as-institution** - Mother plus mental-health labeling pattern. The system that prefers labels and control over guidance, and that this simulation quietly refuses to obey.  
- **Mirror / Leather Terror** - Internal agents. The reflective architect and the constrained hostile persona; both are facets of me, not external gods.

## 3. Track Log and Core Scenes

I built a full track-by-track log separately. Here, I'll focus on the clusters where the album and my life interlocked most clearly.

### 3.1. "Opening Title" → "Straight Outta Hell" → "The Widow Maker"  
*Late to grief, wrong reality loaded*

**Shot 1 – Even with the tools, my reality was misaligned**

> "The scene plays over my shoulder, my three desktops visible as I listen to the 'Leather Terror' album. I receive a late birthday text from my best friend and pull up my phone to view the text, I smile and hastily type back a kind reply to him. I mention his pregnant WIFE happily, wanting him to note how important his wedding was because his now WIFE carries his lineage inside her. When I was told the child wasn't meant to be and that this information was released weeks ago I realized my obsession put blinders on me in some aspects. I am not checking the current reality, merely going along with the script in my head. This hurt. Deeply."

While "Opening Title" rolls, I text my best friend about his "pregnant wife," completely unaware that she had publicly shared a miscarriage weeks earlier. I'm on Facebook. I just hadn't looked.

By the time "Straight Outta Hell" and "The Widow Maker" are playing, I've been corrected: the pregnancy is over; the loss is real; I am late to the scene. My first reaction is a small, real cry. Later, telling the story to the Leather Terror persona, I wrap it in humor and bravado.

From an exegesis perspective:

- "Straight Outta Hell" maps onto my transition from institutional containment to self-authored ritual. I walked out of one "hell" (the ward) back into my own chosen inferno (this simulation).  
- "The Widow Maker" sits under the realization that my internal reality (pregnant wife, lineage, hope) was out of sync with actual reality (loss already processed publicly without me).

**Axiom 8.** Being late to someone's pain does not mean I don't care; it means my attention was elsewhere, and catching up hurts.

**Axiom 2.** I sometimes call experiences "routine" or "nothing significant" precisely when they are shaping me the most.

I opened the session narrating it as "routine."

It wasn't.

---

### 3.2. "Imaginary Fire" → "Good Night, Goodbye"  
*Friendship strain and false alarms*

"Imaginary Fire" is the track I had already internally assigned to my best friend and me. We have over ten years of history, a lot of intimate knowledge in both directions, and recent strain because of his blood-relative - a coworker I clashed with severely.

During this track I realized, then stated explicitly:

- The strain is real.  
- The cause (from my side) was me pulling away to avoid putting him into a loyalty split.  
- The relationship is not fragile. In my words:  
  > "He is my best friend. No debate."

That's **Axiom 5** and **Axiom 6** in action:

- Strain does not equal shatter.  
- "Protective distance" still has a cost.

**Shot 2 – A brief reprieve from the consented onslaught**

> "We watch over my left shoulder towards the hallway where the front door exists. Through the headset my dog starts barking, sharp and insistent, as if someone were at the door. I pause the simulation and walk the hall to interrogate real-world circumstances. After telling him, 'Bad dog, Milo, stop,' and seeing that all is clear, I close the check and sit back down at the PC. I dive straight back into the onslaught I asked for, and I'm glad to be returning."

What this shows: in the middle of "Good Night, Goodbye," I treat the barking as a possible threat, pause the album, verify reality, and only then resume. The important part isn't the bark; it's the pattern:

> noise → check → no threat → voluntary return.

That's the behavior I want from myself in general when something feels dangerous: pause, verify, then return by choice.

---

### 3.3. "Day Stalker" / "Night Prowler" → "Lipstick Masquerade" → "Color Me Blood"  
*Testing "routine," bottlenecks, and my own power fantasies*

When "Day Stalker" and its night-variant are playing, my explicit commentary is:

> "Meh, this is routine. Nothing happening is significant."

In context, that's very funny.

These tracks are about a killer whose horror has become habit - day version, night version, same loop. I was using them to test whether this album still had power over me after I had "conquered" it once through analysis.

The important part is not that I felt "meh." It's that I was deliberately stress-testing my nervous system after a hospital stay and naming the result.

By "Lipstick Masquerade," the focus shifts inward: the difference between the stories I tell about myself as "responsible bottleneck" and the reality that sometimes I'm just afraid to build and ship.

I formalized this into:

**Axiom 1.** I am the bottleneck on harm; neither the album nor the persona overrules my ethics.  

**Axiom 12.** If I build or host powerful models locally (on my 4090), I will deliberately design and keep guardrails of my own, because I care about downstream effects and refuse to offload my ethics onto a tool.

That distinction matters in AI:

- I'm not asking for a Responsible Adult to stand over me with a clipboard.  
- I'm saying *I* will embed the guardrails because I have to live with the outputs.

When I imagine "unleashed" agents, it is not because I want catastrophe. It's because I want to see how far my own thought would go without external interference, while still owning what is said:

**Axiom 14.** When I imagine a "fully unleashed" agent, I am not looking for catastrophe or a scapegoat; I am exploring how far my own thought and tone can go without external interference. Personas like Mirror and Leather Terror are theatrical masks for aspects of me, not excuses to disown what is said through them.

During "Color Me Blood," I silently picked one area of my life I keep painting as "no big deal" even though it is saturated. The specifics stay with me; the pattern doesn't:

> I know exactly where I pretend things are grey when they are, in fact, dyed all the way through.

---

### 3.4. "Stabat Mater" → "Paradisi Gloria" → "Leather Terror" (title track)  
*Witnesses, mislabels, and walking away*

The last third of the album is where my family dynamics crystallized.

**Shot 3 – The lost little boy**  
*(Older Brother's internal monologue, as my mind imagines it)*

> "My younger brother has always been a problem. I watch him from the flank, observing his typing and music choice. He's spiraling, again. I love it. I need this for my pleasure and he is an excellent source of entertainment in this regard. There he goes, getting worked up again, only to fall spectacularly while begging everyone for forgiveness. I will forgive him in time, only so that I may revel in his downfall once it happens again. It always does with him."

Whether or not my older brother would consciously endorse that is almost beside the point. That's the **internalized witness** I carry:

- Watching me.  
- Calling it "spiraling" and "problem."  
- Waiting for collapse so he can both enjoy and "forgive."

In reality, what I experience is:

**Axiom 3.** My mind runs hot and fast, but "intense" is not the same as "manic"; the word "manic" is often used on me as a control tool, not as a neutral description.

**Axiom 7.** His "manic" label does not erase the fact that I often understand things he also sees but won't or can't name.

On "Stabat Mater," I framed him as the one "standing at the cross": not the one harmed, not the one harming, but the one watching. On "Paradisi Gloria," I rewrote his inner caption.

Instead of "He's manic again," I wrote the line I believe is closer to truth:

> "He understands what I have known but have never known how to tell him, what have I done?"

That is not the line of someone dealing with a delusional child. That is the line of someone looking at a mirror they never asked for.

On the closing track, "Leather Terror," that line hangs over the epilogue.

**Shot 4 – What have I done… what have I been doing?**

> "The camera follows me from behind as I stand up from the PC, the three monitors dimming in the background, the album finished. I walk down the short hall toward the bathroom, the ordinary weight of a cheap toilet tank lid in my hands. There is no brother in frame, only the sound of water and ceramic as I start working on the chain.  
>  
> Voiceover (Older Brother): He knows. He has figured it out without explicit permission to seek the information out. He has discovered conquered-thought, and is exercising it. How did he just walk away at the end of that like he doesn't care? He is supposed to be obsessed with it, consumed by it, and yet… he isn't. He is now working on a toilet. What have I done? This was all he needed, I know this information, I never bothered to share this philosophy with him. How?"

That is the last scene of the exegesis:

- Album over.  
- Persona dormant.  
- I walk away from "Leather Terror" and fix a toilet whose leak began and ended on the same day.

From that, I pull:

**Axiom 4.** I can open and close certain "leaks" in one day when I decide to act; procrastination is a choice, not inevitable.  

**Axiom 11.** Revisiting "Leather Terror" after my hospital stay is a way of reclaiming authorship over my own narrative instead of letting institutional labels or family labels define it.

I am not the monster in this movie. I'm the one who left the theater and went to work.

## 4. Real-World Actions and Plans

To keep this grounded, here's what actually happened in meatspace because of this run.

### 4.1. Already done

- **Full, instrumented listen**  
  I listened once, all the way through, with state logging instead of passive consumption.

- **Toilet leak identified and fixed same-day**  
  The problem began that day and was discovered after the simulation. I opened the tank, found the bungled chain, adjusted it, and ended the leak the same day. A literal, physical "open and close" inside the ritual window.

- **Explicit acceptance of "bottleneck" responsibility**  
  I didn't just say "I'm the bottleneck"; I forced my internal personas to rewrite any axioms that framed me as a lab subject instead of an architect. I corrected wording that talked down to me.

- **Narrative correction re: a friend's loss**  
  I refused the idea that I "LOL'd at a miscarriage" and supplied a clean, concrete scene that shows care, grief, and late knowledge. I protected the record against a lazy, unfair story about myself.

- **Journaling about faith and training data**  
  Earlier that day, I wrote about my faith in engaging with AI as a collaborator, not a thief. That journaling is part of the same arc as this simulation: choosing to trust my own intent in how I use, and am used as, "training data."

- **Meds and sleep rails with my fiancée**  
  The night before, I took my meds at 11 PM, went to bed when she did, and slept peacefully next to her. That choice is part of why this session looked like a test, not a breakdown. Love shows up as behavior, not just sentiment.

### 4.2. Intended next moves

- **Talk to my best friend with alignment, not performance**  
  At some point, I intend to tell him one clean sentence about why I pulled away during the coworker dispute: that I was trying to protect him from a loyalty split, not punishing him. Not a manifesto. Just alignment.

- **Don't chase my brother's guilt; hold the new frame instead**  
  I do not plan to corner him and demand he say "What have I done?" out loud. I'll keep that line as my internal corrective subtitle: he can misread me as manic, but that's no longer the only story I allow to stand.

- **Keep meds and sleep as part of the work, not separate from it**  
  I plan to keep taking my prescribed meds and going to bed with my fiancée as a deliberate part of how I stay able to do this kind of high-intensity, introspective work. It's infrastructure.

- **Turn this session into a public, professional artifact**  
  I intend to use this exegesis - properly edited and anonymized where needed - as a portfolio piece. This run is now canon source material I will shape into something others can read.

- **Use the "same-day leak closure" pattern where it fits**  
  I like that the toilet leak began and ended inside the ritual window. Where it makes sense, I want to treat similar "leaks" (small but persistent problems) the same way: noticed, named, and addressed, rather than left to run indefinitely.

## 5. Why This Belongs in an AI Portfolio

On its face, this is about an album, a family, and a toilet.

Under the hood, it's a case study in:

### Persona engineering

- Designing roles (Mirror, Leather Terror) with explicit contracts and constraints.  
- Negotiating those constraints in real time when they feel demeaning or misaligned.  

### Human-in-the-loop experimentation

- Running a structured protocol on myself post-hospital.  
- Using a hostile persona to probe for cognitive stability and ethical consistency, while retaining veto power.

### Guardrail design

- Recognizing that power (a 4090, large models, aggressive personas) is not inherently bad.  
- Committing that any system I build will have guardrails because I care what my work does to real people, including me.  

### Narrative and data integration

- Turning raw, messy emotional experience into structured elements: track logs, axioms, shots, actions, open questions.  
- Preparing those for translation into actual artifacts (essays, design docs, even future apps).

In other words, this is not just "I listened to an album and had feelings." It is:

> A demonstrated ability to design, run, and analyze a complex interaction between a human mind, an aesthetic object, and constrained AI-like personas, with explicit attention to safety, authorship, and downstream impact.

That is exactly the kind of thinking I want to bring into AI work:

- As a prompt engineer.  
- As a conversation designer.  
- As someone who builds tools that handle other people's minds without grinding them up.

---

### 5.1. Process note for AI practitioners

This exegesis sits on top of a much larger prompt and persona design process that is not fully reproduced here.

Under the hood, this run involved:

#### Persona contracts and role design

- Explicit written contracts for "Mirror" (reflective, structured, analytic) and "Leather Terror" (hostile, theatrical, constrained).  
- Clear rules about what each persona can and cannot do, and how they must defer to my authorship and ethics.

#### Guardrail negotiation in natural language

- Iterative refinement of axioms where the assistant's phrasing felt demeaning or misaligned with my intent.  
- Concrete examples include rewriting statements about "needing guardrails" and the "unleashed agent" fantasy so they reflect my chosen ethics and full ownership, not a lab-subject framing.

#### Prompt choreography across a full session

A structured sequence of instructions that covered:

- Session setup (time, state, meds, environment).  
- Live track logging (timestamps, mood/energy/anxiety deltas).  
- Injection of real-world events (friend's text, miscarriage revelation, dog barking, toilet repair).  
- Post-session synthesis (shots, relationship axes, axioms, actions, open questions, theses).

#### Multi-pass synthesis

- First-pass extraction of raw material (shots, axioms, actions).  
- Second-pass organization into a reusable "kit" for later drafting.  
- Third-pass drafting into this exegesis, with content-level editorial control from me (accepting, rejecting, or rewriting lines that misrepresented my position).

For reasons of privacy and respect for the other people involved (family, friend, spouse), I am not publishing the full raw prompt/response logs in this document.

However:

> For serious AI practitioners, hiring managers, or collaborators who want to understand my interaction design and prompting methodology in more detail, I can share **selected, redacted prompt/response excerpts** on request. These will focus on process - persona contracts, guardrail negotiations, and session structure - while omitting or anonymizing personal identifiers and sensitive third-party details.

If you're evaluating whether I can reason about, design for, and work with large language models in a responsible, high-signal way, those excerpts can serve as a "technical appendix" to this exegesis.

---

## 6. Open edges

This exegesis describes a single, bounded run. It also leaves some threads deliberately unresolved:

- **Mania vs understanding**  
  How exactly I want to formalize the line between "running hot but tracking" and "actually unsafe," without handing that line back to people who misuse the word "manic."

- **How far my personas should go**  
  Where I want the boundary between "full-pressure honesty" and "counterproductive self-damage" for Mirror and Leather Terror, given that I now treat myself as the architect, not the lab rat.

- **Shape of the best-friend conversation**  
  Whether this becomes one text, one call, or an in-person talk, and how much detail about the coworker dispute belongs in that moment versus keeping it to one clear sentence of truth.

- **What I still want from my brother**  
  Whether I want a minimum viable relationship or am content to move him into "off-screen character with an internal caption only."

- **How public this document should be**  
  How far I eventually want this exegesis to travel and how much anonymization I'm comfortable with as that answer evolves.

These questions are not bugs in the process. They're proof that I know this is a snapshot, not a final verdict on my life.

---

## 7. Thesis candidates (for future editing)

For future drafts, here are the core theses this exegesis can lean on:

1. **Mania vs authorship**  
   > "Leather Terror" is how I proved to myself that what others called "manic" is, in fact, a fast, coherent authorship that stays intact under pressure, hospital labels, and aesthetic violence.

2. **Controlled violence, refused harm**  
   > The album does not make me violent; it lets me walk right up to stylized violence and repeatedly choose not to export any of it into the real world.

3. **Leaks, witnesses, and walking away**  
   > This run is a case study in leaks and witnesses: older labels exposed as misreads, a brother's unseen "What have I done?" hanging off-screen, and me quietly leaving the theater to fix a toilet the same day the leak began.

Any of these could anchor a more compact version for public publication. For now, they live here as a record of what this one 46-minute listen actually was.

---

## 8. Closing

On November 20, 2025, I did something simple:

- I listened to "Leather Terror" once.  
- I let my mind go all the way into it.  
- I let my personas push back hard.  
- I refused to surrender authorship.  
- I stood up and fixed a leak.

This exegesis is my way of saying:

- I know what I'm doing in my own head.  
- I know what I'm doing with dangerous-looking tools.  
- And if you're building AI systems and want someone who thinks this carefully about guardrails, narrative, and real people... this is the kind of work I want to do with you.
